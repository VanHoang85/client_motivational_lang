They are absolutely sure that they possess the item in question and may not entertain any further discussion or offers related to it.\n\n2.

They are reasonably sure that they have the item, but there might be a slight possibility of error or doubt.\n\n3. Low confidence and certainty: If the speaker says it hesitantly or with a questioning tone, it implies a low level of confidence and certainty.
